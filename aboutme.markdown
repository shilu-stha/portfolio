Personally, I have a strong value set, and I believe this is the driver for me to make decisions in life.

### Communication

Communication is of highest importance to me. If you can’t say it in words then type it but at least communicate. However, I believe more in verbal and in-person communication. I am a good listener, I will listen to you patiently and understand your perspective. However, when time comes I wish the same from you, to listen patiently and understand.

### Honesty

With open communication I value honesty. I value honestly even if it is bitter, so even if its harsh we can be honest about it and work towards improving it. If there’s no resolution then we can part ways anyhow we’ll have the satisfaction that we tried.

### Humbleness

Kindness and compassion is what I was broughup with. I believe that no one should forget their roots and even though their heads are in the cloud their feet should always be grounded. Meaning, inspite of your success or achievements you should always be humble and have a sense of respect for everyone.

### Hardwork

There is nothing more rewarding than hardwork. I've learned this throughout my childhood which helped shaped me become who I am at present. Hardwork with discipline will get your far more ahead in life than anything that comes easy.

<b>
I am open to communication, and if you believe I could be a good fit for a position at your company or if you have any ideas where I could offer support, I am eager to collaborate.
