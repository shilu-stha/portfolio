For over a decade, my identity was rooted in being a hands-on software architect and developer. I spent most of my time designing systems, shipping features, and keeping production services stable. Machine learning was something I used occasionally through APIs or prebuilt models—but I treated it as a black box.

Starting my MSc in Artificial Intelligence changed that.

I wanted to go beyond “calling the model” and instead understand **how** models learn, why they sometimes fail, and what it really means to optimise them. My early MSc modules introduced me to the foundations of machine learning: supervised learning, optimisation, generalisation, and probabilistic reasoning.

What surprised me most was how many ML ideas felt familiar from my engineering background:

- Hyperparameters reminded me of system configuration tuning.
- Overfitting looked like over-engineering a solution.
- Regularisation felt similar to constraints we impose in system design.

This blog series is my way of documenting that transition—from treating ML as a tool, to understanding it as a field of study. I’ll cover both the **mathematical side** and the **implementation side**, reflecting my dual background as a developer and an emerging researcher.
