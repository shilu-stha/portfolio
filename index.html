  <p>
    I am a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in this field,
    specializing initially in mobile application development using Android and
    later transitioning to cross-platform applications using React Native. My
    passion lies in creating innovative applications that address global
    challenges and streamline daily tasks by digitizing processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am on a career break, actively enhancing my AI skills to
    integrate AI into mobile applications. I am working on personal projects
    while exploring potential career paths.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am open to communication, and if you believe I could be a good fit for a
    position at your company or if you have any ideas where I could offer
    support, I am eager to collaborate. Feel free to reach out to me via
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shilushrestha/">LinkedIn</a> or
    <a href="mailto: sth.shilu@gmail.com">Email</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Iâ€™m not doing programming, you'll find me in my mat with mindful
    practice of yoga and sometimes out in the mountains for a trek. Other than
    that I like to dance and read fiction.
